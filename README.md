SecondConf Code of Conduct
==========================

This is a fork of the 2013 [PyCon code of conduct][pycon-coc] including the
staff and attendee guides.

SecondConf is following PyCon's lead and posting its Code of Conduct as a
GitHub repository so that changes can be suggested, wording corrected, and we
can continue to iterate -- as a community -- on these policies and procedures.

SecondConf is still very much in a learning process. The conference is 3 years
old and still evolving. The conference is staffed by volunteers who care very
deeply about the community and improving the conference for all attendees. Each
year we see significant improvements (such as the code of conduct and staff
procedures).

No changes are final until approved by the SecondConf Committee. Versions in
place for a given year will be clearly marked. The website contents on
secondconf.com will clearly state the revision of the documents posted.
